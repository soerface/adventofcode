The jungle must be too overgrown and difficult to navigate in vehicles or access from the air; the Elves' expedition traditionally goes on foot. As your boats approach land, the Elves begin taking inventory of their supplies. One important consideration is food - in particular, the number of Calories each Elf is carrying (your puzzle input).

The Elves take turns writing down the number of Calories contained by the various meals, snacks, rations, etc. that they've brought with them, one item per line. Each Elf separates their own inventory from the previous Elf's inventory (if any) by a blank line.

For example, suppose the Elves finish writing their items' Calories and end up with the following list:

1000
2000
3000

4000

5000
6000

7000
8000
9000

10000

This list represents the Calories of the food carried by five Elves:

    The first Elf is carrying food with 1000, 2000, and 3000 Calories, a total of 6000 Calories.
    The second Elf is carrying one food item with 4000 Calories.
    The third Elf is carrying food with 5000 and 6000 Calories, a total of 11000 Calories.
    The fourth Elf is carrying food with 7000, 8000, and 9000 Calories, a total of 24000 Calories.
    The fifth Elf is carrying one food item with 10000 Calories.

In case the Elves get hungry and need extra snacks, they need to know which Elf to ask: they'd like to know how many Calories are being carried by the Elf carrying the most Calories. In the example above, this is 24000 (carried by the fourth Elf).

Find the Elf carrying the most Calories. How many total Calories is that Elf carrying?

o solve this problem, we can first split the input into a list of lists, where each sublist contains the food items carried by an Elf. We can do this by splitting the input by the blank lines. Then, we can iterate through the sublists and calculate the total Calories carried by each Elf by summing the items in each sublist. Finally, we can find the maximum Calories carried by any Elf by taking the maximum of the list of total Calories.

Here is some code that solves the problem:

```
# Read the input
input_str = """
1000
2000
3000

4000

5000
6000

7000
8000
9000

10000
"""

# Split the input by blank lines
food_lists = [list(map(int, x.strip().split('\n'))) for x in input_str.strip().split('\n\n')]

# Calculate the total Calories carried by each Elf
totals = [sum(food_list) for food_list in food_lists]

# Find the maximum Calories carried by any Elf
max_calories = max(totals)

# Print the result
print(max_calories)
```

Running this code will print 24000, which is the correct answer.

Change the code to read the input from a file

# Response #
############

To read the input from a file, we can use the open() function to open the file and read its contents. Then, we can use the .read() method to read the contents of the file as a string.

Here is how we can modify the code to read the input from a file:

```
# Open the input file and read its contents
with open('input.txt') as file:
  input_str = file.read()

# Split the input by blank lines
food_lists = [list(map(int, x.strip().split('\n'))) for x in input_str.strip().split('\n\n')]

# Calculate the total Calories carried by each Elf
totals = [sum(food_list) for food_list in food_lists]

# Find the maximum Calories carried by any Elf
max_calories = max(totals)

# Print the result
print(max_calories)
```

Now, the code will read the input from the file input.txt instead of using the hardcoded input.

--- Part Two ---

By the time you calculate the answer to the Elves' question, they've already realized that the Elf carrying the most Calories of food might eventually run out of snacks.

To avoid this unacceptable situation, the Elves would instead like to know the total Calories carried by the top three Elves carrying the most Calories. That way, even if one of those Elves runs out of snacks, they still have two backups.

In the example above, the top three Elves are the fourth Elf (with 24000 Calories), then the third Elf (with 11000 Calories), then the fifth Elf (with 10000 Calories). The sum of the Calories carried by these three elves is 45000.

Find the top three Elves carrying the most Calories. How many Calories are those Elves carrying in total?

############
# Response #
############

To solve this part of the problem, we can modify the code from the previous part to find the top three Elves carrying the most Calories.

To do this, we can first sort the list of total Calories in descending order. Then, we can take the first three items from the sorted list and sum them to find the total Calories carried by the top three Elves.

Here is how we can modify the code to solve this part of the problem:

```
# Open the input file and read its contents
with open('input.txt') as file:
  input_str = file.read()

# Split the input by blank lines
food_lists = [list(map(int, x.strip().split('\n'))) for x in input_str.strip().split('\n\n')]

# Calculate the total Calories carried by each Elf
totals = [sum(food_list) for food_list in food_lists]

# Sort the list of total Calories in descending order
totals = sorted(totals, reverse=True)

# Take the top three Elves and find the total Calories they are carrying
top_three_total = sum(totals[:3])

# Print the result
print(top_three_total)
```

This code will print the total Calories carried by the top three Elves, which is the correct answer to this part of the problem.
